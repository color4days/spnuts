# SPnuts - a Fork of 'Pnuts' Scripting Language

SPnuts is a fork of Pnuts language authored by Toyokazu Tomatsu.
Although Pnuts is a good language, it was not maintained.  Then,
I forked Pnuts under permission of Mr. Tomatsu.

I'm plan to rewrite source of Pnuts by Scala and to be built under sbt.
